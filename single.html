            <b>Introduction</b>
            <br/>
            This application enables you to visually analyze the 3D motion of the humerus and scapula during various
            single-plane shoulder motions. It decomposes the orientation of the humerus and scapula via commonly utilized
            methods in shoulder biomechanics research. This allows you to visually compare differences between these methods.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Frame Selection</b>
            <br/>
            The slider bar at the top of the page allows you to select the frame in the data capture which you would
            like to analyze. Notice that as you change the frame number, the orientation of the humerus and scapula
            in each view is updated. This same functionality can be achieved using the plots on the lower-right
            quadrant by hovering over a plot-line. Once you have chosen a frame to analyze, click the downward facing arrow
            next to the slider bar. This same functionality can be achieved by clicking a point on a plot.

            </p>

            <p>
            <b>The Views</b>
            <br/>
            The lower-right view plots the components of the decomposed orientation of the humerus/scapula as specified
            in the adjustable label in the upper-left corner of this quadrant. Each of the remaining 3 views
            decompose the humerus or scapula orientation according to the adjustable label shown in the upper-left or
            upper-right corner of the quadrant. In all views, the elbow is represented by a thin black or blue rectangle
            attached to the humerus. Axial orientation is illustrated by the angle between the black (starting) and blue
            (ending) rectangle.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Interactions</b>
            <br/>
            Rotate by dragging the left mouse button, zoom using the scroll-wheel, and pan by
            dragging the right mouse button. To maximize one of the views, double-click on it. Another double-click
            brings you back to the 4-pane view. The humerus views are linked to each other so as you rotate, pan, or zoom
            in one view, the same action happens in the other humerus views.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Animations</b>
            <br/>
            Once you have selected a frame to decompose (see <b>Frame Selection</b>), the application allows you to
            animate the sub-rotations associated with each decomposition. The state buttons at bottom of the application
            allow you to choose which sub-rotation you would like to animate. Once you select a sub-rotation, the
            play/pause button and slide bar at the bottom  of each quadrant provide control of the animation for the
            selected sub-rotation.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Options</b>
            <br/>
            The <b>Open Controls</b> button in the lower-right corner of the page provides various configuration options
            for the application. Notably, the <b>Humerus Base</b> option allows you to change whether the humerus is
            decomposed and plotted by measuring its orientation against the <b>Torso</b> or <b>Scapula</b>. The
            <b>Visualize Angles</b> option allows you to display a simple visualization of the humerus angles as measured
            by a particular decomposition sequence. The <b>Spherical Area</b> option enables the visualization of the
            actual path traversed by the distal humerus (blue), and the path assumed by the chosen decomposition sequence
            (brown). The spherical area between these two trajectories describes the difference between true and apparent
            axial rotation for the xz'y'' and Swing Twist decompositions.
