This repository contains code that creates an animated and interactive Javascript application for exploring various orientation decomposition sequences for the humerus - with an emphasis on axial rotation. It is built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/), a Javascript 3D library. Currently it is a work in progress. I wanted to put together a demonstration for my Ph.D. committee to determine if this concept could serve as one of my Ph.D. aims. Fortunately, it can!

This is a list of items that need to be completed before this code is available for public release:

* Expand comments.
* Add license.
